Hi, I'm Nataliia Uvarova, usually hiding under the _AAzza_ nickname.

I'm studing for my master in NTUU 'KPI', Ukraine and Gjovik University College
in Norway.

For some uknown reason, I always surrounded by people, who want to talk about
Haskell, so if you one of those, special Hi! for you.

Some ways to contact me:

## About the blog

The first and current purpose of this blog is to report the
status of the participation in OutreachProgramForWomen 2014. So first posts
will be devoted to Openstack, Python and FOSS, but later it eventually will contain
other posts.

Thanks for reading!
