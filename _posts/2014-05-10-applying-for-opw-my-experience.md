title: "Applying for OPW: my experience"
---
This is the first and introductory post to the blog. Main purpose of it to "break the ice" of
empty page and write something about OPW 2014.

_Note: You can read what is OPW here - [OutreachProgramForWoman](https://wiki.gnome.org/OutreachProgramForWomen)_.

In this post I want to give some tips for future applicants. It is the
summary of my experience for applying and getting the internship.

### don't think you have no time to apply.

I managed to select an organization, write project
proposal for it, do the required contribution (even two of them) in six days.

So don't panic, if you like me learn about existance of this program the week before the deadline.
It was just like _boom!_ - if you want to participate, there is no time to loose.

### don't be silent.
If you are from that kind of people, that just enters
any room and gets everyone's attention and you even _enjoy_ this,
free to skip this item.
All above is not about me - I'm shy and self-inconfident and I know this.
But also I know, that doesn't mean that I should be silent. So I force myself to ask question, answer
other's question, just post random smiles from time to time.
Of course, first several messages are usually like

> Hey, I'm completely unsure, but it seems like ...

> For some unknown reason, I don't know the answer yet, so may I ask the question...

After extremely friendly answers, all this boilerplate unsureness desappeares, and --- hey,
I managed to speak to complete strangers :)

### about finding the project
There should be some clever advises about how to select the project etc.
If you need some, there are really good (post)[http://anteaya.info/blog/2013/03/29/suggestions-for-gnome-opw-applicants/]. But
I was so lucky to skip it all (and I definetely have no time). For me it was like

- filter list of participating organizations for use of Python
- hey, there is OpenStack
- write to general IRC #openstack-opw
- meet aggressively friendly mentor from OpenStack/Marconi flaper87, who just literally
pushes me to #openstack-marconi.
And the whole Marconi was so aggressively friendly and so ignorant of my shyness, so it was impossible to leave them.
- done :).

### getting the internship is not the most important

The most important is that contribution you do, people you talk, task solved.
In the end, it was completly irrelevant, would I get those internship or not.
Because main outcome I got - experience of contributing to big open-source project
and confidence that I will contunue to contribute in future.
